**DevOps (Short for Development and Operations)**

Nowadays, DevOps is one of the buzzyword among everyone. Everyone talks about it but not everyone know what actually DevOps is. DevOps is an approach based on lean and agile principles in which business owners, development team, operations and quality assurance teams collaborate to deliver software in a continuous manner that enables the business to more quickly sieze market opportunities and reduce the time to include customer feedback. 

In simple words, DevOps is a methodology, a method by which we shorten the Software development lifecycles through collaboration and by applying automation at different stages of software development and provide continuous delivery with high sofware quality.

Before diving into DevOps tools and practices, it‚Äôs essential to understand some fundamental concepts. Here are some questions I asked myself before learning DevOps to gain a clearer understanding of what we're about to learn. Let‚Äôs start by addressing these 3 core questions:

1. What is SDLC?
2. What is DevOps?
3. Why do we need DevOps?

üëâ What is SDLC?
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing high-quality software. It ensures cost-effectiveness and quality through various phases, including planning, designing, development, and testing. Each phase focuses on improving code quality and product performance.

üëâ What is DevOps?
Nowadays, DevOps (Short for Development and Operations) is one of the buzzwords among everyone. Everyone talks about it but not everyone knows what actually DevOps is? DevOps is an approach based on lean and agile principles in which business owners, development team, operations and quality assurance teams collaborate to deliver software in a continuous manner that enables the business to more quickly sieze market opportunities and reduce the time to include customer feedback.
In simple words, DevOps is a methodology, a method by which we shorten the Software development lifecycles through collaboration and by applying automation at different stages of software development and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

üëâ Why Do We Need DevOps?
To answer this, we must first understand some common issues in the Software Development Life Cycle:
‚ùé Silo Mentality: Lack of collaboration between development and operations teams.
‚ùé Manual Work: Insufficient automation leading to inefficiencies.
‚ùé Software Quality: Challenges in maintaining high-quality standards.
‚ùé Delivery Delays: Slow time-to-market.

DevOps addresses these issues by promoting a culture of collaboration, removing silos, and implementing continuous automation. This results in timely software delivery, improved quality, and better alignment with customer needs.
Understanding these concepts will provide clarity as we delve into DevOps practices and tools.
